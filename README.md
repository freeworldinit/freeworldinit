Hello World,
     
     We are the Free World Initiative! We are a tight knit group of Designers, Developers, Social-Engineers, Doxers, and Hackers that have come together to fight for freedom on the Internet. Our mission is to provide a secure way to use the Internet freely at your own discretion.
In the near future, we will be bringing you the Free World Initiative website which will provide free premium downloads to source codes, professional lvl graphic designs, and hacking tools! We will also be bringing you our Free World Market service which will provide premium & professional services as follows: Doxing, Social Engineering, Defacing, Rooting, Verified & Working CCs, Developing, and Custom Graphic Design at a yet to be decided rate. We as a collective will stand by our members in a time of need and protect as we deem fit, so if that means running you off the internet than we shall do so! We will not be involving ourselves as a collective in social media "beef", as it is a childish act & social media is FEDsoup, we will however be active on social media w/ keeping our users updated on our sites & services, as well as posting our own work to our Free World Initiative social media accounts! We are here mainly to bring freedom of use to the Internet, but we are also here to cause a little bit of chaos along the way... So you may see a few big name corporations falling to their knees, or maybe a few governments or law enforcement agencies, we've yet to really decide what we want to attack ;) so keep an eye open & an ear out for the Free World Initiative, we will be striking with a very precise and powerful blow!!!
